# White Hole
White Hole is a self published sci-fi novel. The R script analyses the text in the novel for word frequency and relationships. It is a novice text mining/ data science project.

# Usage
Due to copyright, the content of the novel, i.e. the text, cannot be made public. The underlying word document which has been used in the code, has therefore *not* been uploaded. No such document will be uploaded in the future. 

The code *cannot* run on any machine without the necessary file.
